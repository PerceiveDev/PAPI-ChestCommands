# PAPI-ChestCommands
A bukkit plugin to allow ChestCommands to use PlaceholderAPI placeholders

This plugin allows the lore of ChestCommands items to use PlaceholderAPI placeholders by injecting a modified [`Icon`](https://github.com/filoghost/ChestCommands/blob/master/ChestCommands/src/com/gmail/filoghost/chestcommands/api/Icon.java) class. This means that if [@filoghost](https://github.com/filoghost) changes anything major in the `Icon` class then this will most likely break. **This plugin is built to be used with ChestCommands v3.1.4. Use it with any other version at your *own* risk.**
